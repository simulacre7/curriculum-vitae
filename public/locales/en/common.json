  "summary": "I’m Kihwan Kim, a Frontend Engineer. At RIDI, I worked on large-scale content platforms, focusing on structural improvements and user experience optimization. Currently, at Levvels, a subsidiary of Dunamu, I continue to enhance frontend architecture and design interaction layers for commerce-oriented services. During my master’s studies, I researched visual analytics and AI-driven interfaces, and I’ve since integrated that analytical mindset into practical frontend development to design flexible and scalable user experiences. My experience across both industry and academia has given me a balanced perspective — not only on technical craftsmanship but also on problem framing and cross-functional collaboration.",
